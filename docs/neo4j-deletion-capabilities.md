# Knowledge Graph Service - Enhanced Deletion Capabilities

## Overview

The Knowledge Graph Service now provides comprehensive deletion functionality designed for safe, intelligent data management in production knowledge graph environments. These capabilities go far beyond simple node deletion to provide sophisticated data lifecycle management.

## Enhanced Deletion Methods

### 1. Enhanced `deleteNode()` - Smart Node Deletion

```typescript
async deleteNode(nodeId: string, options?: {
  nodeType?: string;           // Validate node type before deletion
  cascadeDelete?: boolean;     // Delete with all relationships
  skipDependencyCheck?: boolean; // Override safety checks
}): Promise<{ deleted: boolean; reason?: string }>
```

**Features**:
-  **Type validation**: Ensures you're deleting the expected node type
-  **Dependency checking**: Prevents deletion of nodes with incoming relationships
-  **Cascade options**: Can delete nodes with all their relationships
-  **Safety by default**: Checks for dependencies unless explicitly overridden
-  **Detailed feedback**: Returns success status and failure reasons

**Example**:
```typescript
// Safe deletion with type validation
const result = await kgService.deleteNode('user-123', {
  nodeType: 'User',
  skipDependencyCheck: false
});

// Force deletion with cascade
const forceResult = await kgService.deleteNode('session-456', {
  cascadeDelete: true
});
```

### 2. `checkNodeDependencies()` - Dependency Analysis

```typescript
async checkNodeDependencies(nodeId: string): Promise<{
  hasIncomingRelationships: boolean;
  incomingCount: number;
  outgoingCount: number;
  relationshipTypes: string[];
}>
```

**Features**:
-  **Relationship counting**: Counts incoming and outgoing relationships
-  **Type analysis**: Lists all relationship types connected to the node
-  **Safety assessment**: Determines if deletion is safe

### 3. `deleteRelationship()` - Targeted Relationship Removal

```typescript
async deleteRelationship(
  sourceNodeId: string, 
  targetNodeId: string, 
  relationshipType?: string
): Promise<{ deleted: boolean; deletedCount: number }>
```

**Features**:
-  **Precise targeting**: Delete specific relationships between nodes
-  **Type filtering**: Optionally specify relationship type
-  **Batch support**: Can delete multiple relationships matching criteria
-  **Count reporting**: Returns number of relationships deleted

### 4. `deleteNodesByType()` - Batch Deletion

```typescript
async deleteNodesByType(
  nodeType: string, 
  filter?: Record<string, any>
): Promise<{ deletedCount: number }>
```

**Features**:
-  **Type-based batching**: Delete all nodes of a specific type
-  **Property filtering**: Add WHERE conditions based on node properties
-  **Safe batching**: Uses the same sanitization as other methods
-  **Count reporting**: Returns total nodes deleted

**Example**:
```typescript
// Delete all test sessions
await kgService.deleteNodesByType('Session', { 
  source: 'test' 
});

// Delete all memories with low importance
await kgService.deleteNodesByType('Memory', { 
  importance: 1 
});
```

### 5. `cascadeDeleteSession()` - Domain-Specific Cascade

```typescript
async cascadeDeleteSession(sessionId: string): Promise<{
  deletedNodes: number;
  deletedRelationships: number;
}>
```

**Features**:
-  **Domain knowledge**: Understands session data structure
-  **Complete cleanup**: Deletes session + messages + tool invocations + files + memories
-  **Detailed reporting**: Provides breakdown of what was deleted
-  **Optimized queries**: Single query deletes entire session tree

**Use case**: Perfect for implementing user data deletion, session cleanup, or GDPR compliance.

### 6. `cleanupOrphanedNodes()` - Maintenance Operations

```typescript
async cleanupOrphanedNodes(excludeNodeTypes: string[] = []): Promise<{
  deletedCount: number;
  deletedNodeTypes: Record<string, number>;
}>
```

**Features**:
-  **Orphan detection**: Finds nodes with no relationships
-  **Type exclusions**: Protect certain node types from cleanup
-  **Detailed reporting**: Shows what types were cleaned up
-  **Maintenance ready**: Perfect for scheduled cleanup jobs

## Production Use Cases

### Data Lifecycle Management
- **User Account Deletion**: Use `cascadeDeleteSession()` for complete user data removal
- **Test Data Cleanup**: Use `deleteNodesByType()` with filters to remove test data
- **Maintenance Operations**: Use `cleanupOrphanedNodes()` in scheduled maintenance

### Safe Refactoring
- **Schema Changes**: Use dependency checking before node type migrations  
- **Relationship Restructuring**: Use `deleteRelationship()` for precise changes
- **Data Quality**: Use cleanup operations to maintain graph health

### Development & Testing
- **Test Isolation**: Create and delete test data safely
- **Data Seeding**: Clean up before seeding fresh test data
- **Integration Testing**: Verify deletion behavior in CI/CD

## Safety Features

### Dependency Protection
- **Default safety**: Won't delete nodes with incoming relationships
- **Explicit override**: Can force deletion when needed
- **Clear feedback**: Explains why deletion failed

### Type Validation
- **Schema enforcement**: Ensures you're deleting the expected node type
- **Prevents accidents**: Reduces risk of deleting wrong nodes
- **Clear errors**: Provides meaningful error messages

### Transaction Safety
- **Atomic operations**: Each deletion is transactional
- **Error handling**: Proper rollback on failures
- **Logging**: Comprehensive operation logging

## Integration with Knowledge Graph Schema

Based on the knowledge graph schema from `knowledge-graph-plan.md`, these deletion methods are designed to work with:

- **Session Management**: `cascadeDeleteSession()` handles Session → Message → ToolInvocation → File chains
- **Memory Lifecycle**: Smart deletion of Memory nodes with tag and relationship cleanup
- **Content Management**: Safe removal of Document nodes with dependency checking
- **User Data**: Complete user data removal across all related entities

## Testing & Validation

Both basic and advanced deletion capabilities are thoroughly tested:

- **`npm run test:neo4j`**: Tests basic deletion with dependency checking
- **`npm run test:neo4j-advanced`**: Tests all advanced deletion scenarios
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Session cascade, batch operations, orphan cleanup
- **Real-world scenarios**: Tests actual knowledge graph structures

The enhanced deletion system is production-ready and provides the foundation for robust knowledge graph data management in the Skynet Agent system.
