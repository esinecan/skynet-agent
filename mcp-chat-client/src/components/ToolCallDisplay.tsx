## Overview
This document outlines the design for a single-user, local-use chat client that leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool calls and the Vercel AI SDK for language model interactions. The application will be designed for local execution, eliminating the need for user authentication and management.

## Architecture
The architecture consists of three main components:
1. **MCP Client**: Manages communication with the MCP server.
2. **LLM Service**: Interfaces with the Vercel AI SDK to generate responses using language models.
3. **User Interface**: A simple React-based UI for user interaction.

The application will run locally, with all components communicating over local transport mechanisms (e.g., stdio or HTTP).

## Components

### MCP Client
- **Purpose**: To facilitate communication with the MCP server, allowing the client to call tools and retrieve resources.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use the `MCPClient` class to connect to the MCP server.
  - Implement methods to call tools and retrieve available tools.
  - Handle transport configuration (e.g., using `StdioClientTransport` for local execution).

### LLM Service
- **Purpose**: To interact with the Vercel AI SDK for generating responses based on user input and context.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create an `LLMService` class that initializes the language model based on the selected provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
  - Implement a method to generate responses, which aggregates tools from the MCP client and sends requests to the language model.
  - Handle multimodal inputs (text and attachments) if necessary.

### User Interface
- **Purpose**: To provide a simple chat interface for user interaction.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use React to build a chat interface with input fields for user messages and a display area for conversation history.
  - Implement a `ToolButton` component to allow users to trigger tool calls.
  - Handle user input and display responses from the LLM service.

## Data Flow
1. **User Input**: The user types a message in the chat interface and submits it.
2. **LLM Service**: The message is sent to the `LLMService`, which prepares the request, including any relevant tools from the MCP client.
3. **MCP Client**: The `LLMService` calls the appropriate tools via the `MCPClient`.
4. **Response Generation**: The LLM generates a response based on the input and any tool outputs.
5. **Display Output**: The response is sent back to the chat interface and displayed to the user.

## Error Handling
- Implement error handling in the `MCPClient` to manage connection issues and tool call failures.
- Log errors using a simple logger utility to provide feedback in the console.
- Gracefully handle missing tools or invalid inputs in the LLM service.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Set Up Project**: Initialize a new React project with TypeScript.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary packages, including the Vercel AI SDK and MCP SDK.
3. **Implement MCP Client**: Create the `MCPClient` class to manage tool calls.
4. **Implement LLM Service**: Create the `LLMService` class to handle interactions with the language model.
5. **Build User Interface**: Develop the chat interface using React components.
6. **Integrate Components**: Connect the UI with the `LLMService` and `MCPClient`.
7. **Testing**: Write unit tests for each component and perform integration testing.
8. **Documentation**: Document the code and provide usage instructions.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Write tests for the `MCPClient` and `LLMService` to ensure methods behave as expected.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between the UI and backend services.
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Conduct testing with real users to gather feedback on usability and functionality.

## Conclusion
This technical design document outlines the implementation of a local chat client utilizing the Model Context Protocol and Vercel AI SDK. The design focuses on simplicity and ease of use, allowing users to interact with language models and tools without the complexity of user management or authentication. The outlined architecture and components provide a clear path for development and testing, ensuring a robust and functional application.
