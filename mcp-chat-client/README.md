## Overview
This document outlines the design for a single-user, local-use chat client that leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool calls and the Vercel AI SDK for language model interactions. The application will be designed for local execution without the need for user authentication or management, making it suitable for personal use or development purposes.

## Architecture
The architecture consists of three main components:
1. **MCP Client**: Manages communication with the MCP server and handles tool calls.
2. **LLM Service**: Interfaces with the Vercel AI SDK to generate responses based on user input and context.
3. **User Interface**: A simple React-based frontend that allows users to interact with the chat client.

The application will run locally, using Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend.

## Components

### MCP Client
- **Purpose**: To manage connections to the MCP server and facilitate tool calls.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use the `MCPClient` class to connect to the MCP server.
  - Implement methods to call tools and handle responses.
  - Support two types of transports: Streamable HTTP and stdio.

### LLM Service
- **Purpose**: To generate responses using the Vercel AI SDK.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create an `LLMService` class that initializes the language model based on the specified provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
  - Implement a method to generate responses that aggregates tools from the MCP client and sends requests to the language model.

### User Interface
- **Purpose**: To provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the chat client.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use React to create a simple chat interface with an input field for user messages and a display area for conversation history.
  - Implement a `ChatInterface` component that handles user input and displays responses from the LLM.

## Data Flow
1. The user enters a message in the chat interface.
2. The message is sent to the `LLMService`, which prepares the context and tools.
3. The `LLMService` sends a request to the language model using the Vercel AI SDK.
4. The language model generates a response, which is returned to the `LLMService`.
5. The response is displayed in the chat interface.

## Error Handling
- Implement error handling in the MCP client to catch connection issues and tool call failures.
- Log errors using a simple logger utility to provide feedback in the console.
- Display user-friendly error messages in the chat interface when issues occur.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Setup Project**:
   - Initialize a new Node.js project.
   - Install necessary dependencies: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `ai`, `react`, `react-dom`, etc.
   
2. **Create MCP Client**:
   - Implement the `MCPClient` class to manage connections and tool calls.
   - Support both Streamable HTTP and stdio transports.

3. **Implement LLM Service**:
   - Create the `LLMService` class to handle language model interactions.
   - Integrate the Vercel AI SDK for generating responses.

4. **Develop User Interface**:
   - Create the `ChatInterface` component for user interaction.
   - Implement state management to handle conversation history.

5. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for the MCP client and LLM service.
   - Perform integration testing to ensure the components work together seamlessly.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Document the code and provide usage instructions for the chat client.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components (MCP client, LLM service) for expected behavior.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure that the entire flow from user input to response generation works correctly.
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Gather feedback from potential users to refine the interface and functionality.

## Conclusion
This design document outlines the implementation of a local chat client using the Model Context Protocol and Vercel AI SDK. By focusing on a single-user experience without authentication, the application aims to provide a straightforward and efficient way to interact with language models and tools. The modular architecture allows for easy expansion and integration of additional features in the future.
